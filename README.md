# Dead Man's Hand

*A death-game survival mod for Minecraft 1.19.2 (Fabric or Quilt).*

One night the sky fills with fireworks. They come closer and closer, there's a white flash, and you wake up in the
middle of a huge scramble crossing in a city you've never seen. Every person and animal is gone.

Your phone shows a **visa** that is counting down. When it reaches zero, a laser comes down from the sky. The only way
to get more days is to win **games**. At night a building somewhere in the city lights up, and every game is marked
by a playing card:

- **Suit = kind of game.** ♣ teamwork, ♠ physical, ♦ brains, ♥ betrayal.
- **Number = difficulty.** Clearing a game adds that many days to your visa.

Everything in this mod is original: the title, the characters, the city, the dialogue and the art. The games
themselves follow the rules and mechanics of the survival-game story that inspired it. The mod is not affiliated with
that series or its makers.

## What you need

- Minecraft **1.19.2**
- **Quilt Loader** or **Fabric Loader** (0.14.21 or newer)
- **Quilted Fabric API** or **Fabric API** for 1.19.2. If you already play with Possessed Grin and Requiem, you have this.

Put the `dead-mans-hand` jar in your `mods` folder. It works next to Possessed Grin; the two don't touch each other.

## Getting there

- **On its own:** after your first full day in a world, the fireworks come for you around midnight.
- **Straight away:** in a world with cheats on, type `/borderland enter`.

You arrive at the crossing with **1 day** on your visa, which is 20 real minutes. The first venue lights up as soon as
you've had a moment to look around. Your screen shows its distance and direction:

`VENUE OPEN  140 m NE`

Use the **phone** (right-click) for your visa, your cards, or the rules of the game you're in.

## How a game works

1. **Entry.** A venue lights up near you at dusk, but nobody knows which game it is. The sign only says to step
   inside. Walk into the lit entrance and you're registered. Entry closes one minute after the first person signs up,
   or when every place is taken. Empty places are filled by other players who woke up the same night.
2. **No way out.** From the moment you register, leaving the venue means the laser. In survival you're switched to
   adventure mode for the game, so the venue can't be dug through, and you get your game mode back afterwards.
3. **Rules.** When entry closes, you're told the game, its difficulty and its rules. Then the clock starts. The boss
   bar shows the time left.
4. **Clear it** and you get the card and its days. **Fail** and you die.

While you're registered for a game or playing one, your visa can't run out. You'll either win days or die in the game.

**Dying over there** wakes you up at home: was any of it real? A day later, the fireworks can come again. With
`permadeath=true` in the config, death is final: you stay behind as a spectator and watch.

## The games

Season one is complete: all ten number-card games from the show, plus the seven of spades it only shows in a flashback.

### 3♣ LIVE OR DIE
A building of five rooms. Each room has two doors, signed **LIVE** and **DIE**, and a clue on the wall that tells you
which door really leads on. Behind the other door is death. Each room has its own time limit, and it gets shorter
every room. When a room's time runs out, it fills with gas, and then the gas catches fire. Get out of the building
alive. Eight minutes overall.

### 5♠ TAG
A nine-storey L-shaped apartment block with three stairwells. Somewhere in it is the **safe zone**, with a spade on
the wall and two buttons. Two different people must press them at the same moment. "It" walks the galleries in a
horse's head and shoots at anyone it sees with a submachine gun. If it touches you, you're dead. The mask means it
only sees straight ahead, so stay out of its line of sight. The courtyard is mined, and a bomb goes off when the
twenty minutes are up.

### 7♥ WOLF AND LAMBS
A glasshouse full of hedges and trees. One of you is the **wolf** and the rest are lambs. Your goggles tell you which
you are. When the wolf and a lamb look each other in the eye, they swap. When the fifteen minutes are up, every lamb's
collar goes off, and only the wolf walks out.

### 4♣ DISTANCE
You wake up in a dark highway tunnel beside an old, graffiti-covered bus. The rules only say *reach the goal*, and
your phone shows a distance. Halfway along there's a supply table, further on a black panther in the dark, and further
still a motorcycle. At the end there's a wall, and when someone reaches it, the water comes. Pay attention to which
way the number moves. The original was 10 km and two hours; this tunnel is scaled down to 400 m and six minutes.

### 4♦ THREE SWITCHES
A reservoir under the city. There are three switches, A, B and C, and one of them lights the bulb in the room next
door. While its door is closed you can flip them as often as you like. While it's open, each switch can be flipped
only once, and the door won't close while anyone is inside. You get **one** answer, on the panel. All the while the
water is rising, and when it reaches the transformer, everyone in there dies.

### 10♣ BINGO IN THE DARK
A match factory: twenty-five huge rooms in a five-by-five grid, all pitch dark. You start somewhere in the dark with
**nine matches** (use one to strike it: ten seconds of light). Each room has its number painted on its walls, and
lighting a match there puts the number on everyone's bingo card in that room's square. The card is the grid; the
middle is free. A row, a column or a diagonal clears everyone still alive. When your last match goes out, you're out.
Matches can be handed to other people.

### 2♠ HUMAN ELEVATOR
An unfinished tower with an open lift shaft. You hang from the bar under the lift (**hold SNEAK**) while it climbs
sixteen floors to the roof, stopping now and then for as long as it likes. Your grip wears out the longer you hang,
and more slowly if you've eaten well. Let go and you fall the height of the building.

### 2♣ BORROWING RACE
A power plant with the alarm going. You play in pairs, and each pair draws a slip naming something to borrow: a red
hard hat, the shift log, a pressure gauge... It's in a barrel somewhere in the plant. Bring it to the control room
desk with your partner beside you before the alarm stops (eight minutes). *The show only shows this game in passing
and never its rules, so these rules are made up to fit what it does show.*

### 6♠ BEAST HUNT
An amusement park after dark, and the big cats are out of their cages: lions, cheetahs, leopards, a cougar and a black
panther. Everyone is prey. Kill every predator and everyone left alive clears it. Weapons are allowed, and there's a
rack of them just inside the gate for whoever gets there first. No time limit.

### 10♥ WITCH HUNT
This one comes to you. It happens at **the Lagoon**, the camp. One night a girl is found at the front desk with a
knife in her heart, and the speakers announce the rules: whoever killed her is the witch, the witch is somewhere in
the camp, and the witch must be thrown into the bonfire in the garden within twenty minutes (two hours in the show).
The guard decides the quickest way is to burn everyone. Think about who could have done it. Read her diary. Use her
body to pick it up and carry it, or use someone standing by the fire to throw them in.

### 7♠ BOILING DEATH
A football stadium. Everyone starts on the pitch, then something goes off underneath it and the bowl starts filling
with boiling water. Climb the stands and get out through a gate in the top of the outer wall before the water reaches
you. Most of the gates are barred, and pieces of the stands are falling away. The rules say only: get out.

## Season two: the face cards

Once you've cleared 5 games (`face_cards_after` in the config), the second stage begins. The games are run by the
people who live here, and each holds a face card worth 11 to 13 days.

### J♥ SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
A prison. Everyone's collar shows a suit on the back. You can see everyone else's on their name tag, but never your
own. You can talk freely: ask someone *"what's my mark?"* and they'll tell you, truthfully or not. When the cells open,
go into a cell alone and give your answer (use the terminal, or `/answer hearts`). If you're wrong, or say nothing,
your collar goes off. Then every mark changes. One of the players is secretly the Jack of Hearts and lies. When the Jack
dies, everyone left clears it, so work out who it is and make sure they're told a lie. Hitting anyone is forbidden.

### K♦ BALANCE SCALE
A courtroom with five podiums, each over a vat of acid. Every round, everyone picks a number from 0 to 100
(`/answer 37`). The target is the average times 0.8, and whoever is closest wins the round. Everyone else loses a point.
At minus ten your scale tips. Every time someone dies a new rule is added: two players who pick the same number both
lose; an exact hit costs everyone else two points; and with two players left, if one picks 0, a 100 beats it. Leaving
your podium means the laser.

### Q♣ TARGET
A water plant: seven narrow concrete ribs over a deep empty shaft, one rib per pair. Throw the glowing balls to knock
the others off. Fall and you're dead. The last pair standing clears it.

### J♣ BAGWORM
An auditorium hung with ropes of different heights. Hold Shift to keep your grip, swing from rope to rope, and kick
others off (attack them). Touch the floor and you're out. When the Jack, on the highest rope, falls, everyone still
hanging clears it.

### J♠ CHAMPION
A dark dojo. The Jack of Spades and his men come at everyone with blades. Melee weapons are allowed and there's a rack
by the door. Bring the Jack down and everyone still standing clears it.

### Q♠ CHECKMATE
A power station yard: sixteen challengers in blue vests against the Queen's four in red. Every vest has a button on its
back. The teams take turns, sixteen rounds. On your team's turn, get behind someone on the other team and press their
button (use them from behind). Pressed, they're frozen for the rest of the turn and change sides next round. Each team's
king can never change sides. After sixteen rounds the bigger team clears it and the other team dies.

### K♣ OSMOSIS
A yard of shipping containers, two teams of five. Each team splits 10,000 points between its members. Touch someone from
the other team (use or hit them) and it's a battle: whoever has more points wins, and the loser pays 500. Teammates
standing against you add their points to yours. You can only battle the same person once. Six items worth 500 to 3,000
are hidden in the containers (use the glowing block). Touch the other team's base for 10,000. While you touch your own
base your points have no limit, and anyone who battles you there pays 10,000. Below zero you're out. When time runs
out, the team with more points clears it. A fallen player's bracelet can be picked up, and its points add to yours.

### K♥ SILENT
An abandoned building: a pitch-dark concrete maze with mirrors at its corners and corridors that loop. No rules are
given. Something big is in there with you. You'll hear it breathing and roaring, but you'll never see it. It hunts by
sound: sprinting is loud, sneaking is quiet. Find the way out.

### Q♥ CROQUET
A rooftop garden and three sets of croquet against the Queen. Punch your ball to hit it (a full swing hits harder)
through the four hoops in order, then strike the stake. Going through your hoop earns another shot. Finish three sets
and you clear it. Between sets there's tea, and the chance to quit, which means the laser. While you play, she keeps
telling you none of this is real.

### J♦ MAHJONG
A tatami room, four at the table, one of them the Jack, and everyone in a collar that goes off if you leave your seat.
Four hands of simplified mahjong: draw, then discard by clicking a tile in chat. Any complete hand wins (four sets and
a pair, or seven pairs). Click TSUMO or RON when it's offered. After the last hand only first place survives.

### K♠ SURVIVAL
No venue: the game is the whole city. A gunman in a mask, the King of Spades, walks it with an anti-tank rifle and an
assault rifle, his blimp hanging over him so you can always see roughly where he is. You get no weapons, though there
are some in the depot where you register. Outlive him, or bring him down.

### Q♦ PARKING
The show never shows this game. This version is made for the mod. In a multi-storey car park, every level has a row
of eight cars and a board of clues, and exactly one car fits every clue. Start it (use it) and the barrier to the next
ramp lifts. Start the wrong one and it's the last thing you do. Reach the roof before time runs out.

Season three is on the way.

## The Lagoon (the camp)

A resort hotel in the city where the players who've lasted longest live: a pool, a garden with a bonfire that never
goes out, rooms upstairs, and a guard with guns. The first time you walk in, its leader tells you the rules. Every card
belongs to the camp, so hand yours in at **the wall** in the lobby (hold a card and use the wall). Guns are for the
guard only, and traitors die. When the wall is full, they say, everyone goes home.

The ten of hearts comes to the camp on a night when you're staying there, once you've been there a while and cleared at
least three games of your own.

## The city

The Borderland is its own dimension: an empty Tokyo-like city that generates forever.

- **Downtown towers**, shops and apartments further out, parks, car parks and an **elevated railway**.
- **Abandoned cars** on the roads, vending machines still glowing, and billboards and giant screens for brands
  nobody will buy again.
- The **scramble crossing** in the middle, with screens on every corner. This is where you wake up.
- **The Lagoon**, a resort hotel taken over by the players who've lasted longest (see below).
- **Other players** wander the streets: never many, and never where you're looking. Each one has a name, a past, a
  nature (brave, timid, selfish, kind, clever or reckless) and their own way of playing every game.
- **No animals and no monsters.** Nothing spawns over there.

Every venue stands on its own fixed lot, so you can find them again:

| Card | Game | Entrance (x, z) |
|---|---|---|
| 3♣ | Live or Die | 37, -66 |
| 5♠ | Tag | -166, 120 |
| 7♥ | Wolf and Lambs | 200, 60 |
| 4♣ | Distance | -60, -250 (stairs down to the tunnel) |
| 4♦ | Three Switches | -200, -100 (stairs down to the reservoir) |
| 10♣ | Bingo in the Dark | 100, -69 |
| 2♠ | Human Elevator | -28, 112 |
| 2♣ | Borrowing Race | 164, -69 |
| 6♠ | Beast Hunt | -156, -5 |
| 10♥ | The Lagoon (camp) | 292, -5 |
| J♥ | Solitary Confinement | -92, -69 |

## Talking to the other players (optional AI)

Type in chat near another player and they answer. Without AI they use short built-in lines. With AI they really talk:
they know which game they're in, what's happening around them and how you've treated them.

Open `config/deadmanshand.properties`:

- **Groq (free, online):** sign up at https://console.groq.com, open "API Keys", create a key and paste it after
  `groq_api_key=`. The models in `groq_models` are tried in order. When one hits its free limit, the next takes over.
- **Ollama (free, on your computer):** install it from https://ollama.com, run `ollama pull gemma3:4b`, and set
  `ollama=backup` (used when Groq can't answer) or `ollama=main`.

If you've set up Possessed Grin's AI, Dead Man's Hand copies those settings the first time it starts. Never post your
key anywhere public.

**They do what they say.** When another player says they're taking a door, starting a car, picking a number or quitting,
they really do it. You can ask them too: *"Riku, take the left door"*. Whether they listen depends on how much they trust
you and what kind of person they are. When they decide something on their own, they say so first.

## Config (`config/deadmanshand.properties`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `crossing` | `auto` | `auto`: the fireworks come at midnight. `command`: only with `/borderland enter`. |
| `crossing_after_days` | `1` | Days you play a world before the first crossing (0 = the very first night). |
| `arrival_visa_days` | `1` | Days on your visa when you arrive. |
| `return_after_days` | `1` | After you die over there and wake up at home: days before the fireworks can come again. |
| `permadeath` | `false` | `true`: dying over there is final, and you stay behind as a spectator. |
| `face_cards_after` | `5` | Games you must clear before the face cards start for you. |
| `final_after` | `4` | Face cards you must clear before the last games start for you. |

## Commands (cheats on)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/borderland enter` | The fireworks come for you now. |
| `/borderland leave` | Go home alive. |
| `/borderland games` | List the games. |
| `/borderland game <name>` | Light up that game's venue (you have to be over there). |
| `/borderland start` | Close entry now, if you're waiting in a venue. |
| `/borderland visa <days>` | Set your visa. |
| `/answer <word>` | For games where you say or choose something (anyone can use it). |

## Building it yourself

Push this repository to GitHub with `.github/workflows/build.yml` in place. The **Actions** tab builds the jar and
offers it as a download called `dead-mans-hand`. To build locally, run `gradle build` with Gradle 8.14 and Java 21;
the jar ends up in `build/libs/`.

## Note

This mod was written and checked without running Minecraft: the city and every venue were generated and inspected
block by block outside the game. If something misbehaves in game, `logs/latest.log` says what broke.
